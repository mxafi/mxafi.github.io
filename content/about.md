> Thinker, learner, and a doer. I think of stuff and make it happen.

Patent pending on that line, not generic at all.

## My name is Markus Laaksonen

I'm currently doing a lot of stuff. You probably read the things I said on my main page about doing business and systems administration, yes I do that. To add to that, I'm currently learning how to code.

If you want to contact me, feel free to send me a message through firstname@mxa.fi

I'll be replacing that email with a contact form in the future.
