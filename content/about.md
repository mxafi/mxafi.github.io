> Thinker, learner, and a doer. I think of stuff and make it happen.

Patent pending on that line, not generic at all.

## My name is Markus Laaksonen

I'm currently doing a lot of stuff.
You probably read the things I said on my main page about doing business and systems administration, yes I do that.
To add to that, I'm currently learning coding at Hive Helsinki in Finland.

If you want to contact me, feel free to send me an email at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#109;&#97;&#114;&#107;&#117;&#115;&#64;&#109;&#120;&#97;&#46;&#102;&#105;">&#109;&#97;&#114;&#107;&#117;&#115;&#64;&#109;&#120;&#97;&#46;&#102;&#105;</a>

I'll be replacing that email with a contact form in the future.
