> Thinker, learner, and a doer. I think of stuff and make it happen.

Patent pending on that line, not generic at all.

## My name is Markus Laaksonen

I'm currently doing a lot of stuff.
You probably read the things I said on my main page about doing business and systems administration, yes I do that.
To add to that, I'm currently learning coding at Hive Helsinki in Finland.
