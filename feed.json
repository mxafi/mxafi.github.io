This site is going to change, there's no way around that. I'll try every static site generator available, change the place that hosts my site, create serverless functions and all that. Therefore, I can't guarantee nor should there be any expectation of uptime or regular content.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I don't know what this project is going to turn into, but for now, I feel like exploring static site generation and basic website design. In the future, I'll use the following list for inspiration:\n  </p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>Serverless functions</li><li>Copywriting</li><li>Short-form writing from long-form project blogs</li><li>Linktree-ish page for other socials etc.</li><li>Text stenography (not yet)</li><li>GDPR-compliant simple analytics</li><li>Dark/Light -mode switch</li><li>Better fonts</li><li>Art on pages</li><li>Animations on pages</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>\n    Thanks for reading my first post :)\n  </p>",
